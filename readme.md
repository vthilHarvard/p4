###Short description
The project is called "America's kids got talent". This is an event registration system for a Children's talent show.
Users register with the site and by default they're registered as 'Registered'. __Jill and Jamal are the default registered users.__ Only a registered __user__ can create __item__'s for performance. So, one user can have many items.

*   An __item__ has the following fields:
    * id
    * name of school
    * name of item
    * type of item ('Dance'| 'Music' | 'Skit')
    * Number of participants
    * Description
    * Status of the registration('Incomplete', 'Submitted', 'Approved', 'Rejected')

An __item__ is initially 'Incomplete' and can be edited by its creator until it is 'Submitted' to the organizer. Once submitted an __item__ cannot be edited.        
A guest user on the site can see all items but only a registered user can edit/delete his/her own item.

__All pages of the generated code validated in the w3.org validator__
